# SVASSD
Matlab Implementation for SVASSD for building detection in low contrast images.

SVA-SSD proposes a modified version for singleshot multi-box detector based on visual saliency mechanism. The modification is based on three appraoches
1) Modify the SSD backbone based on saliency attention.
2) Modify the SSD head based on optimized Anchorboxes.

SVA-SSD is fed with a special augmentation processes to overcome the low dataset size and decrease the overfitting problems.
